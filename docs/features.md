# SnapKeep – Features and User Capabilities

## Introduction

SnapKeep is a fully offline, privacy-first mobile application that helps users store, organize, search, and interact with their personal files using on-device intelligence. Everything happens locally on the device. No accounts, no cloud sync by default, and no data ever leaves the phone.

This document explains **all features of SnapKeep** and **everything a user can do inside the application**, in detail, from daily usage to advanced interactions.

## 1. Getting Started and App Access

### First-Time Use

When a user opens SnapKeep for the first time, they are guided through a simple introduction explaining what the app does and how it works offline. The user sets a passcode and can optionally enable Face ID or fingerprint authentication for privacy.

If the local AI model is not yet installed, SnapKeep explains the storage size required and asks the user to download it. The user can continue using basic search features even without the AI model.

### App Lock and Privacy

Users can lock SnapKeep with:

• Passcode
• Face ID or fingerprint

When enabled, the lock screen appears every time the app is opened or resumed. This ensures sensitive files like bills, IDs, and certificates stay protected.

## 2. Uploading and Adding Content

Uploading content is the core action in SnapKeep.

### Upload Options

Users can:

• Upload files from device storage
• Add notes manually
• Add images or screenshots

### Adding Context to Files

After uploading a file, the user can:

• Add a short description or note
• Add custom tags
• Select a category such as bill, receipt, ID, certificate, manual, or note

This information helps SnapKeep understand the file without relying on cloud OCR or external services.

## 3. Automatic Organization

SnapKeep automatically organizes files to reduce manual effort.

### File Grouping

Files are grouped by type:
